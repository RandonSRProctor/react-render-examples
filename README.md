# Randy's Starter React App

This app is ready to be copied-and-pasted and simply jump right into a proof of concept so that I don't have to keep setting up all of my configs when I want to make a new tool or example.

## What is set up already?

1. Vite bundled React app. (Start with command `npm run dev`)
2. TypeScript for coding
3. Tailwind for styling
4. Redux Store (Using Redux Toolkit pattern--store & hooks are typed out-of-box)
5. Basic to-do app (Perhaps change to something less complex for future?)

## Set Up/Make it Your Own

_Note: Quickly find all places to set up by searching `TODO` in this project_

1. Title your document (Title tag in index.html)
2. Title your package (`name` property in package.json)
3. Re-run `npm install`
4. Change this README
5. Change upstream and all relevant git info.
6. Seriously, do #5. Push to this branch and become my enemy ☠️

# What is not set up?

- Git
- env (I should do this in the future I use it so much)
- Monorepo/workspace systems
